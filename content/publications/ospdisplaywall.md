    We present dw2, a flexible and easy-to-use software
      infrastructure for interactive rendering of large tiled display
      walls. Our library represents the tiled display wall as a single
      virtual screen through a display 'service', which renderers connect
      to and send image tiles to be displayed, either from an on-site or
      remote cluster. The display service can be easily configured to
      support a range of typical network and display hardware configurations;
      the client library provides a straightforward interface for easy integration
      into existing renderers. We evaluate the performance of our display wall
      service in different configurations using a CPU and GPU ray tracer,
      in both on-site and remote rendering scenarios using multiple display walls.

    Left: The Disney Moana Island rendered remotely with OSPRay's
      path tracer at full detail using 128 Skylake Xeon (SKX) nodes on Stampede2
      and streamed to the 132Mpixel POWERwall display wall, averages 0.2-1.2 FPS.
      Right: The Boeing 777 model, consisting of 349M triangles, rendered remotely with
      OSPRay's scivis renderer using 64 Intel Xeon Phi Knightâ€™s Landing nodes on
      Stampede2 and streamed to the POWERwall, averages 6-7 FPS.
