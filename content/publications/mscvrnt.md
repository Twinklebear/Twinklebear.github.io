  abstract: >
    Researchers in the field of connectomics are working to reconstruct a map of neural
      connections in the brain in order to understand at a fundamental level how the brain processes information.
      Constructing this wiring diagram is done by tracing neurons through high-resolution image stacks acquired
      with fluorescence microscopy imaging techniques. While a large number of automatic tracing algorithms have
      been proposed, these frequently rely on local features in the data and fail on noisy data or ambiguous cases,
      requiring time-consuming manual correction. As a result, manual and semi-automatic tracing methods remain the
      state-of-the-art for creating accurate neuron reconstructions. We propose a new semi-automatic method that uses
      topological features to guide users in tracing neurons and integrate this method within a virtual reality (VR)
      framework previously used for manual tracing. Our approach augments both visualization and interaction with
      topological elements, allowing rapid understanding and tracing of complex morphologies. In our pilot study,
      neuroscientists demonstrated a strong preference for using our tool over prior approaches, reported less
      fatigue during tracing, and commended the ability to better understand possible paths and alternatives.
      Quantitative evaluation of the traces reveals that users' tracing speed increased, while retaining similar
      accuracy compared to a fully manual approach.

      of the possible neuron segments in the data. Our MSC-guided semi-automatic tracing tool enables users to rapidly trace paths and
      view a live preview as they do so (orange line). When satisfied with the trace, they can add it to the reconstruction (white line).
