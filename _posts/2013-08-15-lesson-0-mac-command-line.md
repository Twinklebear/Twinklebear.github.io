{% include JB/setup %}

To build the projects on OS X we'll be using a simple makefile that will include the framework for us.
The makefile assumes you've installed SDL following the instructions in the .dmg file on the SDL2
downloads page and now have it available as a framework. 

If you're unfamiliar with Makefiles a basic introduction can be found [here](http://mrbook.org/tutorials/make/).

The Makefile
-
{% highlight makefile %}
CXX = clang++
SDL = -framework SDL2
# If your compiler is a bit older you may need to change -std=c++11 to -std=c++0x
CXXFLAGS = -Wall -c -std=c++11
LDFLAGS = $(SDL)
EXE = SDL_Lesson0

all: $(EXE)

$(EXE): main.o
	$(CXX) $(LDFLAGS) $< -o $@

main.o: main.cpp
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $< -o $@

clean:
	rm *.o && rm $(EXE)
{% endhighlight %}
<br />

The Test Program
-
To make sure everything has installed properly we’ll try compiling and running a very simple program that initializes the various SDL systems and then quits. If anything goes wrong, an error message will be printed out. The source file should be titled main.cpp, or you can change the main.o build dependency in the makefile to match your source file.

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>
#include <SDL2/SDL.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv){
	if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING) != 0){
		std::cout << "SDL_Init Error: " << SDL_GetError() << std::endl;
		return 1;
	}
	SDL_Quit();

	return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
<br />

The program should run successfully but nothing should appear to happen if you’ve configured everything properly. If an error occurs make sure you’ve followed all the setup steps properly.
