{% include JB/setup %}

Now that we've got the libraries installed we'll want to create a new project to include and
link against SDL. At the end we'll save this as a template project so in the future we can just
load our template and get to work. First we need a new empty C++ project.

<br />

Setting the Include Path
-
We'll need to add the SDL include directory so that the compiler can find the SDL headers.
Since we also want these configurations to be the same for Debug and Release modes, be sure to 
select **All Configurations** on the **Configuration** menu.
To set the path open up the project properties window and open the **C/C++** section. In the **General**
page you'll find an entry titled **Additional Include Directories**, click this box and open the
edit panel through the down arrow at the right side of the box.

</a>
<br />

Add a new folder to this window and navigate to your SDL include directory. If you put
your SDL development files under `C:\` your include directories panel will look like this
after you've selected the include directory correctly.

</a>
<br />

Setting the Library Path
-
To add the library paths and the linker dependencies head to the **Linker** settings section
and open the **General** page. To add the library path select **Additional Library Directories**
and add the lib path, selecting either the 32bit (x86) or 64bit (x64) version of the library.
I've chosen to use the 32bit version for this tutorial series. After setting the
path your entry should look like this if SDL is under `C:\` and you chose the 32bit libraries.

</a>
<br />

Adding the Library Dependencies
-
Now we'll add the libraries themselves as dependencies. Switch to the **Input** page and open
the **Additional Dependencies** entry's edit panel and add `SDL2.lib; SDL2main.lib`.
Once you've done this your Input page should look like so:

<br />

<img class="centered" width="600" height="auto"
	src="/assets/img/lesson_0_vs/library_dependencies_set.png">
</a>
<br />

Selecting the SubSystem
-
The final step is to select the **SubSystem** target. To do this open up the **System** page
and choose either Console or Windows from the drop down. If you choose Windows you won't get
a console window that opens up with stdout, if you choose Console you will. Since I'll be
writing debug messages and error information to stdout for quicker/lazier feedback in
these tutorials I've selected Console. If you have some other file logging you want to
use and don't want a console to open up you should pick Windows. When distributing your
applications be sure to select Windows so your users don't have a console window pop up on them!

</a>
<br />

Testing it out!
-
To make sure everything is setup properly we'll try compiling and running a very simple
program that initializes the various SDL systems and then quits. If anything goes wrong, an
error message will be printed out. Before we can run this program we'll need to copy the
SDL binary into our executable's directory. `SDL2.dll` can be found in the lib directory
of your SDL folder under lib/(x86/x64), use the one for the architecture you linked against.

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>
#include <SDL.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv){
	if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING) != 0){
		std::cout << "SDL_Init Error: " << SDL_GetError() << std::endl;
		return 1;
	}
	SDL_Quit();

	return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
<br />

The program should run successfully but nothing should appear to happen if you've configured everything
properly. If an error occurs make sure you've followed all the steps properly.


Exporting a Template Project
-
To avoid having to go through this setup every time we want to make an SDL project we
can save this one as a template and then simply select it from the new project menu.
To do this select **Export Template** from the **File** menu and configure the template
as desired. Once you've done this the project template will be available under the Visual C++
project selection page.
