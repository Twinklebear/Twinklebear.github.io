## Triangle & Generated Triangle

## Marching Cubes

A data-parallel implementation of Marching Cubes using compute shaders.
Note that as of 5/7/2020 some functionality (3D texture uploads) is not implemented in WebGPU
which would make this easier to implement or include some other features (e.g.,
sampling the volume, adding volume rendering),

## LiDAR Viewer

A viewer for las/laz files. Uses [LASTools.js](https://github.com/Twinklebear/LAStools.js)
to load las/laz files directly in the browser, and renders them as instanced billboard quads.
To run this demo, download the LASTools.js release (liblas.js, liblas.wasm, liblas_wrapper.js)
and place them under `js/`.
