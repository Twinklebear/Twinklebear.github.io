			"abstract": "We present a novel approach to rendering large particle data sets from molecular dynamics,
						 astrophysics and other sources. We employ a new data structure adapted from the original
						 balanced k-d tree, which allows for representation of data with trivial or no overhead.
						 In the OSPRay visualization framework, we have developed an efficient CPU algorithm for
						 traversing, classifying and ray tracing these data. Our approach is able to render up
						 to billions of particles on a typical workstation, purely on the CPU, without any
						 approximations or level-of-detail techniques, and optionally with attribute-based color
						 mapping, dynamic range query, and advanced lighting models such as ambient occlusion
						 and path tracing."
