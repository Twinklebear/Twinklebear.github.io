		<b>20 Jun 2020</b>
		
<p>In this second post of the series we’ll learn about Bind Groups,
which let us pass buffers and textures to our shaders.
When writing a renderer, we typically have inputs which do not make sense as vertex
attributes (e.g., transform matrices, material parameters), or simply cannot be passed
as vertex attributes (e.g., textures). Such parameters are instead
passed as uniforms in GLSL terms, or root parameters in HLSL terms.
The application then associates the desired buffers and textures with the
parameters in the shader. In WebGPU, the association of data to parameters is made using Bind Groups.
In this post, we’ll use Bind Groups to pass a uniform buffer containing a view
transform to our vertex shader, allowing us to add camera controls to our triangle
from the previous post.
If you haven’t read the <a href="/graphics/2020/06/15/0-to-gltf-triangle">first post in this series</a>
I recommend reading that first, as we’ll continue directly off the code written there.</p>

		<b>15 Jun 2020</b>
		
<p>WebGPU is a modern graphics API for the web, in development by the
major browser vendors. When compared to WebGL, WebGPU provides more direct
control over the GPU to allow applications to leverage the hardware
more efficiently, similar to Vulkan and DirectX 12.
WebGPU also exposes additional GPU capabilities not available in WebGL, such as compute
shaders and storage buffers, enabling powerful GPU compute applications
to run on the web. As with the switch from OpenGL to Vulkan, WebGPU
exposes more complexity to the user than WebGL, though the API strikes
a good balance between complexity and usability, and overall is quite nice to work with.
In this series, we’ll learn the key aspects of WebGPU from the ground up,
with the goal of going from zero to a basic glTF model renderer.
This post marks our initial step on this journey, where we’ll setup
a WebGPU context and get a triangle on the screen.</p>

		<b>20 Nov 2019</b>
		
<p>DirectX Ray Tracing, Vulkan’s NV Ray Tracing extension, and OptiX (or collectively, the RTX APIs)
build on the same execution model for running user code to trace
and process rays. The user creates a <em>Shader Binding Table</em> (SBT), which consists of a set
of shader function handles and embedded parameters for these functions. The shaders in the table
are executed depending on whether or not a geometry was hit by a ray, and which geometry was hit.
When a geometry is hit, a set of parameters specified on both the host and
device side of the application combine to determine which shader is executed.
The RTX APIs provide a great deal of flexibility in how the SBT can be set up and
indexed into during rendering, leaving a number of options open to applications.
However, with incorrect SBT access leading
to crashes and difficult bugs, sparse examples or documentation, and
subtle differences in naming and SBT setup between the APIs, properly setting up
and accessing the SBT is an especially thorny part of the RTX APIs for new users.</p>

<p>In this post we’ll look at the similarities and differences of each ray tracing API’s shader
binding table to gain a fundamental understanding of the execution model. I’ll then
present an interactive tool for constructing the SBT, building a scene which uses it,
and executing trace calls on the scene to see which hit groups and miss shaders are called.
Finally, we’ll look at how this model can be brought back to the CPU using Embree,
to potentially build a unified low-level API for ray tracing.</p>

<p><strong>Updated 5/1/2020:</strong> Added discussion on <code>KHR_ray_tracing</code> for Vulkan.</p>

		<b>06 Sep 2019</b>
		
<p>To determine if a hit point can be directly lit by a light source in the scene
we need to perform a visibility test between the point and the light.
In a path tracer we must perform at least one visibility test per hit point
to shade the point, or two if we’re using multiple importance sampling (one for the light
sample, and one for the BSDF sample). When rendering just ambient occlusion,
e.g., for baking occlusion maps, we may send even more shadow rays per hit-point.
Fortunately, shadow rays can be relatively cheap to trace, as
we don’t care about finding the closest hit point or computing surface shading information,
but just whether or not something is intersected by the ray.
There are a few options and combinations of ray flags which we can use
when deciding how to trace shadow rays on RTX (through DXR, OptiX or Vulkan).
I recently learned a method for skipping all hit group shaders (any hit, closest hit)
and instead using just the miss shader to determine if the ray is <em>not</em> occluded.
This was a bit non-obvious to me, though has been used by others
(see <a href="http://intro-to-dxr.cwyman.org/presentations/IntroDXR_ShaderTutorial.pdf">Chris Wyman’s Intro to DXR</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan/tree/master/data/shaders/nv_ray_tracing_shadows">Sascha Willems’s NV Ray Tracing Shadows Example</a>).
After switching to this approach in <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT">ChameleonRT</a>
I decided to run a small benchmark comparing some of the options for tracing shadow rays.
I’ll also discuss an extra trick we can use to simplify the shader binding table setup,
which lets us skip creating an occlusion hit group entirely.</p>
