# WebGL Marching Cubes

Working on an example of marching cubes in WebGL

To compile the WebAssembly version you'll need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and wasm-pack.
After install Rust you can install wasm-pack with `cargo install wasm-pack`.
Then build the WASM code: `wasm-pack build -t web --release`, and
run a local webserver to serve the files.
