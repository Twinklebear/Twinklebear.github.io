<h3>Hardware Used and Other Details</h3>
<p>
Render times were measured using <code>std::chrono::high_resolution_clock</code> and only include time to render,
ie. time to load the scene and write the images to disk is ignored. The image was rendered with one sample per
pixel since it's incredibly slow without the BVH and I didn't want to wait too long.
