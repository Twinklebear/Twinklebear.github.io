{% include JB/setup %}

Most of my work on my ray tracer for this submission was actually spent writing a Blender
plugin so I can setup scenes and animations with Blender and export them to my renderer's file
format for rendering. Without this plugin it would have been extremely time consuming to setup an
animation as complicated as my submission this year. The plugin is open source and available on
[Github](https://github.com/Twinklebear/tray_rust_blender) if you want to try it out.
It still has many limitations and bugs, but I'm working on improving it.

I've also implemented the Beckman and GGX microfacet models described in
[*Microfacet Models for Refraction through Rough Surfaces*](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~srm/publications/EGSR07-btdf.pdf) by Walter et al. to improve my material model. Over the
winter break last year I spent some time implementing image-parallel distributed rendering,
where parts of the image are rendered in parallel by different computers,
which you can read about [here]({% post_url 2016-01-02-distributed-rendering-with-rust-and-mio %}).

If you'd prefer to watch the short on YouTube I've
[uploaded it there]() as well but the quality is
not as good due to compression. If your browser doesn't play the video properly you can
[download it]() and watch it locally.

Sorry your browser doesn't support HTML5 video, but don't worry you can download the video

The animation contains a few different standard models in addition to ones I created:

- The Stanford Bunny, Buddha, Dragon and Lucy are from the
[Stanford 3D Scanning Repository](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/)
- The Utah Teapot (I used [Morgan McGuire's version](http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/data/meshes.xml))
- The Ajax bust is from [jotero](http://forum.jotero.com/viewtopic.php?t=3)
- A Rust logo model by [Nylithius](http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?362836-Rust-language-3D-logo)

I also make use of a mix of analytic and measured materials, the measured materials come
from the [MERL BRDF Database](http://www.merl.com/brdf/).

# [Open Source!](https://github.com/Twinklebear/tray_rust)

This animation was rendered with my ray tracer tray\_rust, which is an open source path tracer
I've written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Check out the source on
[Github](https://github.com/Twinklebear/tray_rust)! You can also find the
[Blender plugin](https://github.com/Twinklebear/tray_rust_blender) I wrote
to export scenes for this short there as well.
