	<h3>Teapot Rendering Competition Submission</h3>
	<p>
	The final neat feature I chose to implement was participating media with single scattering, appearing in
	this scene in the form of fog and steam. The steam emitting from the teapot was simulated using a small
	<a href="http://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/misc.html">open source fluid simulator</a> released by Wenzel Jakob and
	the fog is a simple volume region with some falloff with height.
	
	The renderer also supports physically based materials such as
	microfacet models, measured BRDF data from the <a href="http://www.merl.com/brdf/">MERL BRDF Database</a>
	and measured metal properties from <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v2/tree/master/scenes/spds/metals">PBRT's SPD files</a>,
   	although this was implemented a bit back. Material properties can also be chosen based on a texture
	allowing for creation of the tile floor here, which is made of rough copper and white diffuse tiles. As
	an extra bonus the renderer is also lock-free, so performance is ok.

	The image was rendered using path tracing with adaptive sampling taking 128 to 2048 samples per pixel with a
	Mitchell-Netravali filter for reconstruction and took 06:30:09 to render.

	<h3>Hardware Used and Other Details</h3>
	<p>
	Render times were measured using <code>std::chrono::high_resolution_clock</code> and only include time to render,
	ie. time to load the scene and write the images to disk is ignored.
