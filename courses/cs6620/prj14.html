	<h3>Teapot Rendering Competition Submission</h3>
	<p>
	For the final neat feature I chose to implement participating media with single scattering in
	the form of smoke and steam. This allows for creating nice atmospheric effects and a steaming teapot.
	I also have support for physically based materials in the form of microfacet models, measured BRDF data from the
	<a href="http://www.merl.com/brdf/">MERL BRDF Database</a> and measured metal properties
	from <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v2/tree/master/scenes/spds/metals">PBRT's SPD files</a>,
   	although this was implemented a bit back. Material properties can also be chosen based on a texture
	allowing for creation of the tile floor, which is made of rough copper and white diffuse tiles. As
	an extra bonus the renderer is also lock-free, so performance is ok.

	The image was rendered using path tracing with adaptive sampling using 128 up to 2048 samples and took TIME HERE
	time to render.

	<h3>Hardware Used and Other Details</h3>
	<p>
	Render times were measured using <code>std::chrono::high_resolution_clock</code> and only include time to render,
	ie. time to load the scene and write the images to disk is ignored.
