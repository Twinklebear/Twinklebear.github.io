<h3>Hardware Used</h3>
<p>
Render times were measured using <code>std::chrono::high_resolution_clock</code> and only include time to render,
ie. time to load the scene and write the images to disk is ignored. Both images were rendered with 8 threads and
8x8 blocks with one sample taken per pixel.
</p>

CPU: Intel i5-2500K @ 4.0GHz, 4 hardware threads <br />
RAM: 8GB 1600MHz DDR3 <br />
Compiler: gcc 4.9.1 (MinGW on Windows)<br />
Compilation Flags: -O3 -mfpmath=sse -march=native -flto

The random block ordering I implemented in <a href="/courses/cs6620/prj2.html">project 2</a> is neat but not so great
if you want to have coherent memory access, so I migrated to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_curve">Z-order</a> mentioned by Ian on the discussion board.
Below is a slowed down video of the box scene for this project rendering with this new ordering. I
did also implement the spiral from center ordering but as you get to the edges of the image it starts to lose locality,
so I think the Z-order is a bit better.
