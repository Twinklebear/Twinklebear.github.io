	The checkerboard is pretty blurry in the distance since my filter method is different than what Cem's code uses
	for the procedural textures, I'm still playing with this a bit. For the image textures I've implemented mipmaps
	(only for power of 2 textures) and anisotropic filtering. The filtering uses information about the texture
	sampling rates computed by tracing ray differentials to determine how many texels need to be sampled along
	each axis in texture space.

	<h3>Hardware Used and Other Details</h3>
	<p>
	Render times were measured using <code>std::chrono::high_resolution_clock</code> and only include time to render,
	ie. time to load the scene and write the images to disk is ignored. The images were rendered with one sample per
	pixel.
