<h3>Hardware Used and Render Times</h3>
<p>
The plot below shows the render times for one sample per pixel averaged over 10 runs, measured from a build compiled with
<code>-O3 -mfpmath=sse -march=native -flto</code>. Measurements were taken using <code>std::chrono::high_resolution_clock</code>
and only include time to render, ie. time to load the scene and write the images to disk is ignored. Now that the renderer
has a bit more work to do we can start to see thread contention hurting the render time when running on significantly
more threads than the number of hardware threads.

<p><b>Desktop</b><br />
CPU: Intel i5-2500K @ 4.0GHz, 4 hardware threads <br />
RAM: 8GB 1600MHz DDR3 <br />
Compiler: gcc 4.8.0 (MinGW on Windows) </p>

<h3>Multithreading Tweaks</h3>
I also tweaked my multithreading implementation based on what was mentioned in class since the original implementation was
pretty braindead, eg. split the image into <code>num_threads</code> blocks, hand them off and relax. This new method
chops the image up into a specified number of blocks, shuffles them and then hands them off to the threads as they render.
This does a bit better job of distributing the workload over the threads and is also more fun to watch. Below is a recording
of the rendering slowed down significantly by inserting some short sleeps into the worker threads.
