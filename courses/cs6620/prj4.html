<h3>Hardware Used and Other Details</h3>

Render times were measured using <code>std::chrono::high_resolution_clock</code> and only include time to render,
ie. time to load the scene and write the images to disk is ignored. Both images were rendered with 8 threads and
8x8 blocks with 16 samples taken per pixel, sample positions were generated with a low-discrepancy (0, 2) sequence.
